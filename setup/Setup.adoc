These steps tell you how to setup for a first time user

== Basic Install

This folder contains several scripts to help out setting stuff up

Firstly, run `python install_all_packages.py`

This will install all packages that have been previously installed

== Idrive

Next go into the idrive folder and run the install_idrive.py file. This file
will download the scripts you need, follow along with the readme

== Scripts Setup

=== Aliases

There should be a file called .bashrc in your home (~) directory

This file may or may not have the following code

  if [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then
  . ~/.bash_aliases
  fi

Add the code below to the .bashrc file

  if [ -f ~/linux_environment/scripts/aliases/bash_aliases ]; then
      . ~/linux_environment/scripts/aliases/bash_aliases
  fi

Save the file and open a new terminal window.  Run the command `testecho`.

This should return `test`
